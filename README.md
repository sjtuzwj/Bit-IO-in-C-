# Bit-IO-in-C-
Use streambuf to implement bit I/O based on the Java library from Algorithms 4th

Thanks to Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, Univ. Princeton.   
Some Changes:  

Data type (particularly char and byte when involved with >> and >>> operator or cast.   
Function invoke( Node('\0',0,readTrie(),readTrie()) , the order is UB in C++)
